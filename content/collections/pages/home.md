We have a large focus on\_RPGs (such as D&D or Pathfinder), board games (such as Betrayal, Sentinels, or Shadow Hunters), and card games (such as Magic: the Gathering), but anyone can feel free to bring anything to play. Everything we do is very casual. We're also very new-player friendly! No experience is required for any of our games/events! There will always be someone to help you out and guide you along so that you can start having fun as quick as possible.\_"
